# Forest_Fire_Detection_using_NLP
This project focuses on detecting forest fires using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing images of fire and no-fire scenarios to train a model capable of distinguishing between the two. The system can be used for early fire detection to help prevent large-scale damage.
